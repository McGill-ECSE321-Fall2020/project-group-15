# ECSE 321 Project Group 15

## Project Overview
ArtSee, a local art gallery has always done business in an old-fashioned way; artists would put their art on display
in a gallery, and customers come and purchase the artwork. The distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 has not allowed 
them to run their business this way anymore and they plan to move their business online. It is our job to design a new software
system using both a mobile application and a web page to replace their physical gallery.

The platform will allow local artists to promote and sell their artwork. An artist can create a profile with email address and 
promote and sell their artwork. Customers can then make a profile, browse artwork and purchase what they are interested in. To collect
the purchased artwork, it can be mailed or picked up at the gallery.
