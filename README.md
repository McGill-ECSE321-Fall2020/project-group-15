# ECSE 321 Project Group 15

## Project Overview
The art gallery in your neighbourhood has always done business the old-fashioned way: connecting local artists
with potential customers by showcasing their work at the gallery. The current pandemic is forcing them to change
their business model and focus their business online. They hired you to help them design a new software system
for them.

The gallery wants to focus on local artists and encourage them to use their website and app to promote and sell
their work. Artists register, create a profile, and present any pieces they have to sell. Interested customers can
browse and buy what they like. The gallery can also promote artwork available on their premises. Artists can deliver
their art to customers by mail or can leave it at the store for pickup. The gallery makes its income on commission
from sold artwork.
